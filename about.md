## My name is Jon Liu.
 I'm a hobbyist coder based in Ottawa, Ontario. I enjoy Python scripting and coding silly little projects for my own amusement. Want to see what I do? Check out my [work experience](/experience.md) and [projects](/projects.md).

 Find out what I've been up to recently over at my [Now page](/now.md).

### Programming languages
Proficient with:
* Python
* C
* Java
* HTML and CSS

Experience with:
* JS
* Rust
* Ruby
* SQL

### Coding
Every time I start a recreational software project, I like to involve something that's radically new to me to compare and contrast with my own experience, as well as just to do it for the first time. Some little things I've made for fun include:

* a web "browser" in 85 lines of code using Tkinter, Python's built-in GUI toolkit;
* an rhythm game for Android that's controlled using no buttons at all, made after one week of experience with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/); and
* a POSIX-compliant command-line application that scrapes websites for Pokémon stats.

### Photography
I enjoy photography as a casual hobby. Lately, I've been taking almost all of my photos using my smartphone, a Pixel 3a. Everywhere I go, I try to take a photo of at least one intresting thing.

Fun fact: I've taken photos of the benches at each metro station in Montreal. Almost every station has its own unique bench design.
