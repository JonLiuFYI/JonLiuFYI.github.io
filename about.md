My name is Jon Liu. I'm a hobbyist coder based in Ottawa, Ontario. I'm looking to turn that interest into a career, and I have the education to back it up.

My two favourite programming languages are Python and C, and I've encountered and worked with plenty of others, like Java and Ruby. Every time I start a recreational software project, I like to involve something that's radically new to me to compare and contrast with my own experience, as well as just to do it for the first time. Some little things I've made for fun include:

* a web "browser" in 85 lines of code using Tkinter, Python's built-in GUI toolkit;
* an Android rhythm game that only uses the gyroscope for input, made after one week of experience with Godot and its included GDScript scripting language; and
* a POSIX-compliant command-line application that scrapes websites for Pokémon stats.

I strongly support the practical and [ethical benefits](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-even-more-important.html) of software that's free-as-in-freedom and open source, which is why I use as much of it as I can. On my PC, I run Fedora as my operating system, and can only name one piece of installed software that isn't free/open-source licensed. I also occasionally contribute improvements back to the open source projects that power my computer. Speaking of my PC…

## My PC
My primary computer is a desktop PC that I assembled for myself, running the Fedora operating system. Inside is a Ryzen 5 2600 processor and an RX 580 graphics card.

My other computer is a Surface Pro 6, which I use as a highly portable laptop and drawing tablet.

## Photography
I enjoy photography as a casual hobby. Lately, I've been taking almost all of my photos using my smartphone, a Pixel 3a. Everywhere I go, I try to take a photo of at least one intresting thing.

Fun fact: I've taken photos of the benches at each metro station in Montreal. Almost every station has its own unique bench design.
