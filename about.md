## My name is Jon Liu.
I'm a coder based in Ottawa, Ontario, with diverse software development experience learned from [personal hobby projects](/projects.md) and [work](/experience.md). This includes communicating with embedded devices over Bluetooth, serving web app requests with a REST API, and collecting and processing large amounts of data.

I'm also a full-time Linux user and have been for several years now. My first experience with operating systems other than Windows was [Ubuntu 8.04, back in 2008]({% post_url 2022-05-03-ubuntu-cd %}), from a free mail-order CD. These days, I daily drive Fedora, but still use Ubuntu frequently.

### Programming languages
Proficient with:
* Python
* Rust
* C and C++

Experience with:
* Java

* SQL

## Photography
I enjoy photography as a hobby. Everywhere I go, I try to take a photo of at least one intresting thing.

Fun fact: I've taken photos of the benches at each metro station in Montreal. Almost every station has its own unique bench design.
