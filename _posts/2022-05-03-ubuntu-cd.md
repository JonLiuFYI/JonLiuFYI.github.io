Did you know Canonical used to send Ubuntu CDs to anyone who asked, completely for free?
<!--more-->

And I've ordered a few. Here's the story of how free CDs shaped who I am.

## Background
I was about 13 years old, in grade 7, when I became curious about "Linux", which I had heard a bit about before, as an alternative operating system to Windows, what I had nearly exclusive experience with. At the time, I liked to mess around with my computer, trying out tweaks and Windows registry hacks, exploring system directories, and trying to customize absolutely everything about it that I could. It didn't feel like that much of a leap to just install and try out a completely different operating system.

That led me to a problem: I didn't know how to "get Linux." Doing some research online, I learned about Ubuntu, the most popular OS that used the Linux kernel, and that seemed like a good place to start.

Next problem: internet access at home was pretty bad at the time, so downloading a CD-sized image wasn't really doable. Luckily for me, it was possible to order a free Ubuntu install CD from Canonical directly.

## It all starts with Hardy Heron
A few weeks later, I received in the mail a CD of Ubuntu 8.04, codenamed Hardy Heron, alongside a few Ubuntu logo stickers.

This is how it all started. I inserted the CD into my computer, booted into the Live CD session after enough time loading, and met Ubuntu for the first time, along with its default wallpaper for 8.04. I think it's the coolest default wallpaper ever shipped with an operating system.

*It's one of the most memorable wallpapers of its decade, alongside Windows XP's Bliss.*

I spent a lot of time messing around with this version of Ubuntu. It, GIMP, and Inkscape were some of my first in-depth experiences with free, open-source software. I played so much AisleRiot Solitaire. It has so many different solitaire games! And I could easily get more software straight from the OS providers. Package managers seemed like a really cool idea to me, which was way better than hunting down and running installer programs in Windows-land.

*I still install Aisleriot Solitaire! Here it is on my Fedora 35 system.*

Another aspect of the Ubuntu desktop experience that wowed me was the customizability compared to Windows. Being able to visit gnome-look.org to get icon themes and window themes that fit my tastes was so cool. I would also spend hours fiddling in the Compiz compositing settings to set up flashy animation effects. I was definitely chasing after the feel of those ancient, cheesy "[Can your Windows PC do this?](https://youtu.be/FogIYtdJN4k)" YouTube videos that showed off cool compositor effects. Wobbly Windows truly is the pinnacle of user experience design.

## Going steady
After those weeks of playing around with my Ubuntu CD, I realized how much I enjoyed the experience and how capable this installation was for almost anything I wanted to do. For that reason, I committed to dual-booting between Windows and Ubuntu.

Over the years since I tried Ubuntu for the first time, I increasingly booted my computer to Ubuntu, not Windows. I ordered further CDs, for Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04.

Eventually, Canonical's free CD shipping service [came to an end](https://ubuntu.com/blog/shipit-comes-to-an-end) during Ubuntu 11.04. However, at this point, I had already become firmly entrenched in the world of desktop GNU/Linux operating systems. I would go to high school and meet friends who were also into this.

## Up to today
Wanting to branch out after several years of using Ubuntu exclusively, I eventually started experimenting with other operating systems. Mint, Fedora, elementary, Archâ€¦ The experience of distro-hopping brought back memories of discovering Ubuntu for the first time on a free CD.

I eventually settled on Fedora because it has a reasonable default out-of-the-box setup and it shipped up-to-date packages that were close to upstream. That's handy for development. And ever since I built myself a desktop PC in 2019, I've not bothered with dual-booting anymore. It's just Fedora on this SSD!

I hardly spend any time customizing my desktop now. Default theme, default fonts, pretty much everything default (Not that modern GNOME desktops have much to customize, anyway). The out-of-the-box experience is a lot better in recent years than when I first started with GNU/Linux operating systems, so there's just less to do after a fresh install. I'm very glad I don't have to install text antialiasing and mp3 support separately now!

Cheers to free CDs. They're what got me to where I am now.
