Ottawa has some nice hiking paths.
<!--more-->

I recently had the opportunity to have some outside time, two metres away from others. I went to Stony Swamp, which is in the Greenbelt. [According to the NCC](https://ncc-ccn.gc.ca/places/stony-swamp), it's "the most ecologically diverse protected area in the Ottawa Valley." There, I took this photo at the lookout on Sarsaparilla Trail, looking out at the seemingly unnamed lake next to it.

I also discovered that there's a forest behind the Nepean Sportsplex, called Pinhey Forest. Each segment of the path had distinct varieties of trees.
