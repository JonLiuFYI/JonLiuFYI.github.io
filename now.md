What's a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about)?

I'm still in Ottawa and the pandemic is still going on. Given that I'm a healthy young adult who does everything from home plus the vaccine supply drama going on in Canada, I'm very far back in the line to get one.

## MST3K is backâ€¦ again
After its revival was abrutply cancelled by Netflix a few years ago, Mystery Science Theater 3000's status was again in limbo. Just a few weeks ago, however, creator Joel Hodgson [started a new crowdfunding campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mst3k/makemoremst3k) to fund another season with the same cast. This time, the core promise of the campaign is that MST3K will be self-published and distributed, bypassing any need to please a video network.

I'm excited for the chance to support an additional season of the show, since I missed the chance to fund the first revival season. RiffTrax, a cousin project formed by other MST3K alumni, already showed that self-publishing worked, and the main drive to produce the show came from its cult following, since networks have consistently been reluctant to keep supporting the show.

## Nice weather on the balcony
I've moved into a new place with a balcony! Good timing, too, since it's late April and the weather is only getting nicer. As a substitute for going outside, going out on the balcony is pretty good. I have a little wooden fold-up table and chair from Ikea just for occasions like this.

## More meatless
Lately, I've been integrating more vegetarian and vegan recipes into my diet. At this point, I make something meatless two days in each week.

Meat is expensive, it's less resource-efficient than just eating what the livestock would eat, and indirectly contributes to climate change. [Canada's healthy eating guide](https://food-guide.canada.ca/en/) already recommends against making meat your only source of protein, and I've found that that's not hard to achieve.

On numerous occasions, I've tried a new recipe, found that I really liked it, then discovered that it's actually vegan, without explicitly being told this.

Why not try out this [peanut butter soup recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHdPLQdjsfE) from You Suck at Cooking?
