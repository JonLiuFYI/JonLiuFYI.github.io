I'm still in Ottawa, though I think about my future (especially career-wise) and where else it could take me. Ever since being stuck at home because of the you-know-what, I've divided my weeks and days into segments to maintain a level of sanity in my home time. That means I spend weekdays working on personal interest projects or taking care of long-neglected TODOs, and spend evenings and weekends on leisure activities.

Currently, my main "workplace" tasks are to search for jobs, get the hang of running this site, and set up an automated online backup solution. When I have the time, I also write original fiction and doodle.

Since being required to stay home, I've upgraded my workout routine, and work out a few times per week. It's a bodyweight routine that involves a piano bench.

I've also gotten more adventurous with cooking at home. After many attempts, I can make pizzas from scratch that are decently similar to the typical delivery kind. I then use a few of the remaining ingredients from the pizza recipe to make [Adam Ragusea's chicken parm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-LY9b1u_io), which is excellent.

Not long before the days of staying put at home, I was getting into tabletop gaming with a few other people I knew. It's very fortunate that Tabletop Simulator exists, however, since it allows me to continue playing tabletop games with friends, but online.
