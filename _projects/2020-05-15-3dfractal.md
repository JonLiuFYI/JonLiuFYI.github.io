title: 3D fractal generator for 3D printers
# cover:
---

This unnamed tool takes user-provided fractal data and outputs a 3D model of it as a file, suitable for 3D printing. It's made in Java.

## About
Although this tool includes a few sample 2D fractals, the user can specify their own, defined as an [iterated function system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterated_function_system) and written in a plaintext file. This tool reads that fractal file, creates a 3D representation of it, then outputs a 3D model of that fractal as an StL file, which can then be given to a 3D printer to create.

I used Java interfaces to generalize the commons traits and behaviours of the built-in and user-provided fractals. An early version of this tool would take multiple hours to generate a 3D model file, depending on the size and complexity of the fractal, but with some study on Java's I/O functionality, I reduced it to around 10 seconds.
