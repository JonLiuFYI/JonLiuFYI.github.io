Here are some highlights of things I've worked on from before 2018.

## shovelware — minigame collection for game jam
*Jun 2016*

shovelware was a fast-paced minigame collection, like WarioWare. Two players play minigames simultaneously and must cooperate to avoid losing. A friend and I made it for the spring 2016 edition of the Games Institute Jam, a local game jam held at the University of Waterloo. The theme was about cooperation.

We agreed on an "API" of sorts, whose specifications our minigames would conform to so minigames would be modular and cross-compatible.

It's written in Lua, for the game framework [love2d](https://love2d.org/). We made it playable to a basic degree by the end of the jam.

## nyyhkyytteek — very compact web browser
*Mar 2015*

nyyhkyytteek was a very simplistic web browser written in 85 lines of Python code. It only supported text. I presented this at [TerribleHack](https://terriblehack.website/) 2015, a hackathon dedicated to bad ideas.

It's written in Python and offers a graphical user interface made in Tkinter, the GUI toolkit included with Python.

## PkDx — command line Pokédex
*Feb 2015*

PkDx was a command-line utility that let the user query for information relating to a Pokémon, like base stats or move compatibility. It could also report stats and information about attacks and abilities. I mainly made it for my own reference use while playing Pokémon Black 2.

It's written in Python and uses [docopt](http://docopt.org/) to define a POSIX-compliant command line interface.

## shutengu — space shooter game
*Dec 2012 ­– Jan 2013*

shutengu was a space shooter-style game with a lot of bullets and few enemies. A partner and I made it as part of a final assignment for a high school computer science class.

It's written in a mix of C and C++. We used SDL to make graphics, audio, and input handling portable across operating systems.
