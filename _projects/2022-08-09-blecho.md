## About
I wrote the chat client in Rust and wrote the chat server as a C++ Arduino sketch. The messages are sent wirelessly over Bluetooth Low Energy. I made this project for a few goals:

* Practice using Rust in a more nontrivial exercise
* Learn to interact with Bluetooth Low Energy
* Become more familiar with embedded programming
