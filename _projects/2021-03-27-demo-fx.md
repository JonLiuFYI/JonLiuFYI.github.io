## About
To try learning graphics programming, I implemented some old-school demoscene effects in Pyxel, a Python-based fantasy console. These animations include a plasma (pictured) and sprite-based pseudo-3D.

* Doubled performance by profiling and manually optimizing slow code sections
* Simplified tedious drawing procedures with automated code generation
