## About
The theme for the 2020 edition of Global Game Jam was "repair." In this game, the player must add new abilities to a defective robot and navigate it to the end of a level. The game is entirely controlled by an external Python script, where players write commands for the robot.

## Making of
As my main contribution to this project, I designed and wrote the interface that connects the game with the player's input script. In addition, the team and I collaborated on developing game concepts and on planning out each person's work milestones. With this coordination, we successfully completed our development goals within the 48-hour time limit.

We contributed code simulataneously to a git repository hosted on GitHub, using separate branches to maximize productivity and encourage modularizing each technical element of the game.

The game is made using Pyxel, a virtual machine and game toolkit that uses Python for scripting. Like [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) or [TIC-80](https://tic.computer/), it features intentional technical limitations that mimic the capabilities of older gaming systems.
