## About
I was tired of having to remember and recite a long FFmpeg incantation just to cut down a screen recording and compress it to a decently small size so I could share it in a chat. This command-line tool acts as a simpler, opinionated interface to FFmpeg, outputting a VP9-encoded WebM video with a user-set duration.

For dead simple *trimming* and *sharing* of a short clip from a video, Trimshare just works. Compared to a video editor like Pitivi:

* Trimshare runs faster
* the video it outputs is smaller
* â€¦yet still has less compression artifacting
