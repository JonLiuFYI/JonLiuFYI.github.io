The [Comparatively Lightly-Operational Clock Converter](https://github.com/JonLiuFYI/clocc) is a bot for Discord chat rooms that converts local times to different time zones, and it's written in Python. It's handy for coordinating meeting times with faraway users.

## About
It's a work in progress. I made it for use on a Discord room that I run.

Any user can tell clocc what time zone they're in, and when they invoke it with a time that's local to them, it will respond with conversions to other time zones. By default, clocc will convert to a list of time zones set by an admin, but users can specify the specific time zones to convert to.

I use Python's asynchronous I/O capabilities to make the bot more responsive. This bot uses discord.py to interact with Discord services, listen for commands, and respond to commands. Its time-converting logic depends on dateparser, a Python module for reading natural-language descriptions of dates and times.
